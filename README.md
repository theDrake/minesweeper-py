minesweeper-py
==============

The classic Minesweeper game, developed using Python 2.7 and PyGTK 2.24 by
David C. Drake (www.davidcdrake.com).

To Launch the Game
------------------
1. Install Python 2.7 (http://python.org/download/).
2. Install PyGTK 2.24 (http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html).
3. Download all "minesweeper-py" files.
4. Double-click on "minesweeper.py".

Controls
--------
1. Left-click to reveal what's under a square (and its empty neighbors). If
   this reveals a mine, you lose the game! If it reveals a number, the number
   indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square.
2. Right-click to place a flag on a square that you suspect of hiding a mine.
