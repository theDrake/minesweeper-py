minesweeper-py
==============

The classic _Minesweeper_ game, developed using [Python 2.7](https://python.org)
and [PyGTK 2.24](https://pypi.org/project/PyGTK) by
[David C. Drake](https://davidcdrake.com).

Controls
--------
* **Left-click** to reveal what's under a square (and its empty neighbors). If
this reveals a mine, you lose the game. If it reveals a number, the number
indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square.
* **Right-click** to place a flag on a square you suspect of hiding a mine.
